Dawn 6.0.2 introduces a new cart drawer feature, additional customization options on the rich text section, and various fixes and enhancements.

### Added
- Important: We introduced new settings to the header section to control top and bottom section padding. This update may cause a visual change to your header. This can be modified by adjusting the bottom padding value.
- We introduced a new theme setting that allows you to control what happens when an item is added to cart. Choose between a cart drawer, a pop-up notification, or linking directly to the cart page.
- The rich text section is now more flexible. You can now customize the desktop content position, the content alignment, the size and formatting of headings, and the number of blocks added to the section.

### Changed

- Important: We moved “Show vendor” and “Enable cart note” checkboxes from the cart template to the theme settings under the heading “Cart”. This update may cause a visual change to your cart. This can be modified by adjusting the checkboxes in the theme settings.

### Fixes and improvements

- On larger screen sizes, the quick add modal included unnecessary empty space. This is now fixed.
- We fixed an issue where the product media gallery sometimes hid the subsequent media when larger values of horizontal grid space were used.
- The product media gallery included unnecessary empty space between the product media and the gallery controls. This is now fixed.
- We fixed an issue where the collapsible row blocks in the collapsible content section were missing padding.
- We fixed an issue where hiding the background of the content container on the slideshow section would not work if a gradient was set as the background color.
- The recaptcha badge was not visible on the contact form. This is now fixed.
- We fixed an issue where adding a menu block to the footer required a heading to display.
- The experience of navigating paginated pages when using a screen reader or keyboard is improved.
- We added a warning to the password footer link opening in a new tab, improving its accessibility.
